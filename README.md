# Color_detection_Project-through-OpenCV-raspberry-pi-3-b-

In this project, there are 2 things first one is color detection and and Bluetooth control through raspberry pi.

The color detection is done with OpenCV(Computer Vision library). Particularly we have focused on the blue color and with repect to that, the blue color HSV values are inputed in the algorithm.  

The webcamera is fixed on the servo motor and we the blue color object is moved from the center point of the camera. The servo motor mover and it tries to ad just the camera to the center.
